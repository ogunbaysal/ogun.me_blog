You just have to log in in these platforms and you will see bars that move giving you the feeling that the content is loading.\n\nThe Skeleton Screens are used to show instant content before having the final content that it\'s loaded <strong>asynchronously</strong>.\nAsynchronously? What the hell is that?\nAsynchronous content is all the content that we have to "wait" for it to load with a temporary delay. The majority of cases is content that comes from a request to a server (through the famous APIs) and we expect from the front-end to receive it but we just don\'t know when and it shouldn\'t prevent the rest of the page from being displayed. I will write more about it in another post, for now it\'s important to simply know that <strong>the asynchronous content is the one that is not loaded instantaneously, but we have to wait to get it</strong>.\n\n## Why are the Skeleton Screens for the UX important?\n\nThe Skeleton Screen are very important because they serve to communicate to the user who will receive a content soon. The user don\'t need to know that we are making a request to an API that takes 2 seconds to return the information, he/she simply needs to know that the page hasn\'t finished loading and the information will be displayed soon. They are very similar to the loaders, they only differ in that they <strong>look like the final content</strong> so that the user knows what he/she is going to receive (context).\n\nIn this post you will see how to <strong>design and implement a Skeleton Screen</strong> for a concrete and complex example: <strong>a datagrid.</strong>\nIt\'s a real example that I made for a [Holaluz](https://www.holaluz.com/en/)\'s project but this time I\'ve changed its CSS to match the style of my website and its content to music instead, much more interesting than electric contracts ;)\n\n## Design a Skeleton Screen\n\n### Step 1: Distinguish the asynchronous content\n\nTo start the design you need to know which content will be asynchronous and which content won\'t be, so it will be synchronous. If you just take care of the design part or you just landed on the project, you\'ll have to ask your front-end colleagues what content the API is sending and most importantly: what content you already know you\'re going to show anyways.\n\nIn this case, I as an UX Engineer in this project (work in design and development), I already had this information and could distinguish between:\n- <strong>Synchronous content:</strong> the structure of the table with its titles, which has 3 columns and I knew their height.\n- <strong>Asynchronous content:</strong> the content of each row that the API will return as an object. Each row is divided into 3 columns.\n\nThis is the graphic scheme I needed to know before taking any design tool:\n\n<image-responsive imageURL="blog/design-and-code-skeletons-screens/scheme.jpg" width="100%" alt="Picture of the schematic where the asynchronous and synchronous content is represented"/>\n\nThe purple rectangles represent the asynchronous content and the green rectangles represent the asynchronous.\n\n### Step 2: Design the skeleton screen with flat elements to supply and represent the asynchronous content.\n\nAnd here the complication comes: <strong> I didn\'t know how many columns of asynchronous content the API was going to return or the length of its content </strong> and there is no way of knowing it because it\'s always different depending on the user or applied filters. I had to create a design that works for all its possible options, either return a row or 50 rows of content when the API request ends.\n\nTo solve this, there are visual resources that we can use, in this case I chose to capture 3 rows with different opacities merging into the final background and 3 columns in each row with random widths.\nIn this way the user get the visual feeling that there is an undefined row lenght. And each row has an undefined width for each column.\n\n<image-responsive imageURL="blog/design-and-code-skeletons-screens/design.jpg" width="100%" alt="Final design photo"/>\n\nLoaders and the skeleton screens are characteristic for their animations since it makes our brain think that things are happening and something is going on.\n\nIn this case I applied two animations, a vertical one that showed one row after another and also remove them once the 3 of them are loaded and the most famous, characteristic and difficult to do: an animation from left to right where a vertical line runs through the content. Something like this:\n\n<img src="https://www.illuminz.com/api/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/loader.gif" alt="Loader" width="100%">\n\n<br>\n\nI don\'t usually design small animations, because I directly code them in CSS to increase speed and to be realistic with the type of animation I can do. What I usually do is to find resources and have the idea in my head that I will develop later in CSS. I understand that many designers work on detailed animations but in my case as an UX Engineer, where I can apply them directly into the code, it\'s easier, more realistic and faster in this way. In any case, if you have to develop complex animations, transitions or flows, I recommend you always design them beforehand. Always use the tool you feel to need at the right time.\n\n## How to code a Skeleton Screen thanks to the opacity modes of Sketch or Photoshop\n\nLet\'s suppose that you already have coded the table layout and it\'s this one:\n\n<Component \n:is="extraComponentLoader"\n:blend="false"\n:verticalAnimation="false"\n:horizontalAnimation="false"\n:isLoading="false"\n/>\n\n### Step 1: Code the 3 rows with its fake content.\n\nMake a <inline-code>tbody</inline-code> alternative to the real table that will change if the boolean <inline-code>isLoading</inline-code> is true. Within this <inline-code>tbody</inline-code> we will generate 3 rows where each one has the number of columns that we already know and each column has a <inline-code>div</inline-code> of a random width. I did it with Vue.js but you can do it with any other framework, it\'s just modifying the template according to a boolean variable that can be changed.\n\n```xml\n<tbody v-if="isLoading">\n  <tr\n    v-for="index in 3"\n    :key="index"\n    class="datagrid__row"\n  >\n    <td\n      v-for="column in columns"\n      :key="column.title"\n    >\n      <span>\n        <div\n          class="datagrid__loader"\n          :style="`width: ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 51) + 50}%;`"\n        />\n      </span>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<Component :is="extraComponentLoader" :blend="false" :verticalAnimation="false" :horizontalAnimation="false" />\n\n### Step 2: Create the vertical animation\n\n<strong>This animation will show one row after another and it will also remove them once the 3 of them are loaded.</strong> First, we define it and then we apply it to <inline-code>datagrid__row</inline-code>. In rows 2 and 3 we will put a delay to obtain the desired effect: one row after another.\n\n```css\n@keyframes aniVertical {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n\n  50% {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n}\n\n.datagrid__row {\n  animation: aniVertical 3s ease;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-fill-mode: forwards;\n  opacity: 0;\n\n  &:nth-child(2) {\n    animation-delay: .5s;\n  }\n\n  &:nth-child(3) {\n    animation-delay: 1s;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Component :is="extraComponentLoader" :blend="false" :horizontalAnimation="false" />\n\n### Step 3: The most complex part of a Skeleton Screen: horizontal animation.\n\nThis second animation is quite tricky. We have to create an animation from left to right that makes the "load" effect, it\'s kind of like a bar that runs through the content and without a doubt the most characteristic animation of a Skeleton Screen. But we find that it\'s very "difficult".\nThe reason is that this animation has to go through different content divs. And it\'s even more complicated in a table since the structure of the HTML is more complex.\n\n<strong>I\'m going to show you the easiest option that I found to solve this problem.</strong>\n\nIt\'s based on some properties that we\'ve seen in <strong>Photoshop or Sketch</strong> applied to CSS. The users of these programs know the layer opacity properties and blending modes. Do you recognize them?\n\n<image-responsive\n    imageURL="blog/design-and-code-skeletons-screens/opacity-properties.png"\n    width="100%"\n    alt="Opacity property picture"\n/>\n\nOne of the blending modes is called <inline-code>overlay</inline-code>, which makes the dark colors of the layer to which we apply it only to be reflected in other dark colors of layers that are below but not to white layers.\n\nIt turns out that we have these same properties available in CSS through <inline-code>mix-blend-mode</inline-code>. This is great for solving the problem of having different content divs where the animation has to go through.\n\nWe will apply an <inline-code>:before</inline-code> to <inline-code>datagrid__row</inline-code> with an absolute position so it will cover the whole row and then we will create an animation, <inline-code>aniHorizontal</inline-code>, to run through the content.\n\n```css\n@keyframes aniHorizontal {\n  0% {\n    background-position: -100% 0;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    background-position: 100% 0;\n  }\n}\n\n.datagrid__row {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\n.datagrid__row:before {\n  content: "";\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  animation-name: aniHorizontal;\n  animation-duration: 3.5s;\n  animation-timing-function: linear;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  background: linear-gradient(\n    to right,\n    #cccccc 2%,\n    #666666 18%,\n    #cccccc 33%\n  );\n  background-size: 50%;\n}\n```\n\nResult:\n\n<Component :is="extraComponentLoader" :blend="false" />\n\nFinally we apply the <inline-code>mix-blend-mode: overlay</inline-code> and magically we will get the vertical and horizontal animations together.\n\n```css\n.datagrid__row:before {\n  mix-blend-mode: overlay;\n}\n```\nResult:\n\n<Component :is="extraComponentLoader" />\n\n## Play with the final result\n\nAll these examples that you\'ve seen before are not images or videos, they are an unique component of Vue that I changed in each case modifying its props.\nNow you can play with this component variation by clicking the checkbox of <inline-code>loading</inline-code> that will change the status from normal to loading state.\n\n<Component :is="extraComponentLoader" checkbox :isLoading="false" />\n\nIn a real application, <inline-code>isLoading</inline-code> variable will be given by the system which implements the asynchronous load and it\'ll be a boolean type too, like this checkbox.\n\n## Things to keep in mind about blend-mode\n\n- <inline-code>Mix-blend-mode: overlay</inline-code> CSS property only works if the rows\' backgrounds are totally white or totally black (the vast majority of the cases).\n\n- <inline-code>Mix-blend-mode</inline-code> for now it\'s not available for IE or Edge. But this will change within a certain time, says [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/mixblendmode/). You can see its support in different browsers [here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-mixblendmode).\n\nIf you want to create a Skeleton Screen on a background that is not black or white, or you have to give support to IE or Edge, I suggest you [this other solution that uses SVG](http://danilowoz.com/create-vue-content-loader/). It\'s much more complex, I\'m not sure you can do it between different divs and it requires you to use an external package but it\'s the best alternative I could find.\n\nIf you liked this tutorial or the songs in the playlist, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarinaAisa) and continue the conversation over there.\nAll feedback is welcome!
